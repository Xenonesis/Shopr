# prd.md – Chat SDK for Shopr eCommerce

## 1. Project Overview
We aim to develop a **Chat SDK** that can be seamlessly integrated into the **Shopr eCommerce platform**.  
The SDK will provide an **interactive chat widget** that enables users to search for products using **text, image, or voice queries** and receive **personalized product recommendations** based on their past orders and click history.  

This feature will improve **customer engagement, reduce search friction, and increase sales conversion** for the Shopr fashion and lifestyle eCommerce platform.

## 2. Goals
- Build a **lightweight, reusable SDK** that can be embedded into the Shopr frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).  
- Support **multi-modal inputs**: Text, Image Upload, Voice.  
- Provide **personalized recommendations** using user history (orders + clickstream).  
- Support **multilingual voice recognition** (English, Hindi, Arabic).  
- Maintain **scalability, performance, and security**.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Core User Features
1. **Text Chat**
   - Users type product queries in the chat box.  
   - System returns relevant product recommendations.  

2. **Image Upload**
   - Users upload an image of a product.  
   - AI model extracts product features and fetches visually similar items.  

3. **Voice Input**
   - Users can speak queries in **English, Hindi, Arabic**.  
   - Voice → converted to text → processed for product search.  

4. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Personalized suggestions using:  
     - Past **order history**.  
     - **Clickstream data** (products viewed).  
   - Combines **content-based filtering + collaborative filtering**.  

5. **Chat UI**
   - Floating widget with:  
     - Text input box.  
     - Image upload button.  
     - Voice mic button.  
   - Shows responses with **product cards** (image, name, price, link).

### 3.2 Developer/Admin Features
- Easy integration with **Shopr frontend** (Vanilla JavaScript component).  
- API key–based configuration for backend services.  
- Customizable branding (colors, logo, position).  
- Logging & analytics (usage statistics, query history).

## 4. Technical Design

### 4.1 Architecture
- **Frontend SDK (Vanilla JavaScript Component)**  
  - Chat bubble + UI (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).  
  - Calls backend APIs for NLP, image, and voice queries.  

- **Backend Services (Node.js + Express / Python for AI)**  
  1. **NLP Engine** – Processes text queries.  
  2. **Image Recognition Engine** – TensorFlow/PyTorch model for similarity search.  
  3. **Voice Recognition Engine** – Speech-to-Text (Google API / Whisper).  
  4. **Recommendation Engine** – Hybrid system (history + catalog search).  
  5. **API Gateway** – REST for communication with Shopr frontend.  

- **Database**  
  - PostgreSQL for orders & clicks.  
  - Elasticsearch for fast product search.  
  - Redis for caching frequent queries.  

- **Infra**  
  - Dockerized services.  
  - Deployable on AWS/GCP.

## 5. Workflow
1. User clicks chat bubble → widget opens.  
2. User enters query (text/image/voice).  
3. Request sent to backend → processed by respective engine.  
4. Recommendation Engine fetches products → ranks them.  
5. Response returned as **product cards** in chat UI.  
6. User can click a product → redirected to product detail page (Shopr).

## 6. Tech Stack
- **Frontend SDK**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS).  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express, Python (for AI models).  
- **NLP**: HuggingFace Transformers, spaCy.  
- **Image Recognition**: TensorFlow/PyTorch (ResNet, CLIP).  
- **Voice Recognition**: Google Speech-to-Text / Whisper.  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch.  
- **Infra**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP.

## 7. Example User Flows
- **Text Query**: "Show me party wear shoes" → Recommendations for party wear footwear.  
- **Image Query**: Uploads photo of a jacket → Similar jackets displayed.  
- **Voice Query (Hindi)**: "मुझे जैकेट दिखाओ" → Jackets recommended.  
- **Personalized Query**: User who bought watches → gets watch accessories recommendations.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Integration with WhatsApp and Telegram for customer support.  
- Sentiment analysis (detecting customer satisfaction levels).  
- Voice replies (Text-to-Speech bot for accessibility).  
- Admin dashboard to manage AI recommendations and view analytics.
